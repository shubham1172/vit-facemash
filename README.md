VIT-facemash
===========
~ Inspired by <i>The Social Network</i>

Pythonish attempt at downloading photos from the only face-book available for our college, i.e. <b> Moodle</b>. 

**Note** : I only tried it for VIT University, Vellore and Chennai. 

To use the script:
* `$ git clone https://github.com/shubham1172/vit-facemash`
* `$ python3 fetch.py`


 <i class="icon-pencil">URL</i> <br/>
 Edit URL according to your college. 
 
 <i class="icon-pencil">Limits</i> <br/>
 Edit R_LOW and R_HIGH accordingly. I experimented with some values and (80,1200) gives some 300 photos for VIT Vellore.

**PS**: Couldn't transform it into <i>facemash</i> because of the following reasons:
- Vellore has female to male ratio as 1:20
- Chennai doesn't allow uploading profile photos anymore because of a bug in moodle. So total count is VERY LESS.
