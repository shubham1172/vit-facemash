VIT-facemash
===========
-- Inspired by <i>The Social Network</i>

Pythonish attempt at downloading photos from the only face-book available for our college, i.e. <b> Moodle</b>. 

**Note** : I only tried it for VIT University, Vellore and Chennai.

 Edit URL according to your college.

 Edit R_LOW and R_HIGH accordingly. I experimented with some values and (80,1200) gives some 300 photos for VIT Vellore.

**PS**: Couldn't transform it into <i>facemash</i> because of the following reasons:
- Vellore has female to male ratio -> 1:20
- Chennai doesn't allow uploading profile photos anymore because of a bug in moodle. So total count is VERY LESS.
